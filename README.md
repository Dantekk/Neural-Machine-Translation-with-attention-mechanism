# Neural-Machine-Translation-with-attention-mechanism
Neural Machine Translation tensorflow/keras application using encoder/decoder model with teacher forcing and Luong Attention mechanism.</br>
The goal is to input sentences in Italian and output the translated sentence in English.

# Repository Contents
The contents of this repository are as follows: 
* `data` folder contain cleaned dataset.
* `saved` folder contains the files trained model.
* `presentation.pdf` contain presentation of the application.

# Project 
There are two versions of the project
1. Object Oriented programming version : all .py files
2. Jupyter Notebook version : Neural_Machine_Translation.ipynb

# How to use it
* `python3 training.py` to train the model
* `python3 inference.py` to inference on new sentences to translate
